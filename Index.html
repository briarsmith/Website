                            I'm Briar Smith,<br><br>
                                If you've made it here, you probably want to learn more about me.<br><br>
                            The first thing you should know about me is that I love to teach and I love to learn.
                            My main focus is in STEM -- incorporating physical systems as mathematical models to
                            create a system or algorithm to deploy engineered technology. However, this is not a
                                definition of what I do, it is only a subset. For example, I've had experience
                                related to web development, I take courses in application programming, digital logic and
                                firmware engineering, and I have a strong interest in quantum mechanics.

                            My roles at BrainStation are what marked the beginning of my lifelong career of teaching and
                                learning. Ever since I was a young child, I have been fascinated with the learning and
                                teaching process; the key factor to success, innovation, and lifelong cognitive
                                strength. BrainStation's entire philosophy is built on the idea that everyone is capable
                                of learning anything with the right mindset, explanation and application.
                                <br><br>

                            For some people, coding can seem like an intimidating new task. This is the challenge that
                                BrainStation overcomes, with needless to say, outstanding results; as seen in Forbes'
                                30 under 30: Education.
                                <br><br>

                            The founders of BrainStation are a group of lifelong learners who introduced the largest
                                free youth coding course in Canada. Through their core values and connections with
                                corporate partnerships, BrainStation has been able to provide full scholarships to youth
                                who are also lifelong, passionate learners. In the summer of 2015, I taught, managed,
                                and assisted lectures in a cutting-edge course in digital literacy, to introduce youth
                                to coding. In just 4 weeks, students were able to build, test and market a web
                                application for a social awareness that is important to them. BrainStation's philosophy
                                isn't limited to students -- they reinforce that nobody is too old or too busy to learn
                                -- by offering part time courses for working professionals, freelancers and
                                entrepreneurs.

                            Overall, I was extremely satisfied with my experience at BrainStation. The companies core
                                values are aligned with my own, which makes my work at BrainStation a part of my journey
                                to lifelong wisdom, innovation, and teaching. A special thank you to Danielle Thé, my
                                direct manager, and Jason Field, formally the CEO, the brains behind BrainStation.
